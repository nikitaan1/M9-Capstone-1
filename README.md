### Welcome to My First Capstone Project at Coding Temple!.

#### In this project, we will analyze student performance data to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam

#### Project Steps:

    1. Data Exploration – Understanding the dataset and key features
    2. Data Preprocessing – Converting categorical variables into numerical format
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying patterns and relationships
    4. Model Training – Fitting and evaluating a predictive model

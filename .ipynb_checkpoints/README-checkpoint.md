## Introduction

Welcome to your capstone project! This project consists of two parts, each designed to showcase different aspects of your skills. Please carefully read through the instructions for both parts:

- **Part 1: Predictive Modeling**
  - In this phase, you will focus on predictive modeling using a dataset of your choice. The goal is to make predictions, either as a classification or regression problem. This part requires an 8-12 minute presentation.

- **Part 2: Data Visualization with Tableau**
  - For the second part of the capstone project, you will showcase your data visualization skills using Tableau. Choose a dataset with a minimum of 10 columns, featuring a mix of categorical and numerical variables. This part requires a 5-7 minute presentation.

Please refer to the respective sections in this README for detailed instructions on each part. Feel free to reach out to me at any time. Good luck!! üçÄ


## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 1: Predictive Modeling

### Introduction

In this part, you will be working on predictive modeling using a dataset of your choice. The goal is to make predictions, either as a classification or regression problem. Below are some recommended places to find interesting datasets:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [UCI Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)
- [Jeff Hale‚Äôs Blog Post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-top-10-best-places-to-find-datasets-8d3b4e31c442)

### Deliverables

Your deliverables for this part include:

1. **Presentation:**
   - Prepare an 8-10 minute presentation with a slide deck highlighting the key aspects of your project. You will also have the opportunity to show off your Streamlit app that you will create.

2. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Create a GitHub repository containing:
     - `README.md`: Provide an overview of your project, its objectives, and a guide on how to navigate your repository.
     - Well-organized Jupyter notebook(s): Clearly outline your methodology, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling.
     - `data` folder: Include the raw and cleaned versions of your dataset.
     - `app.py`: Save your Streamlit app, outlining your project's methodology and results. Ensure the app is deployed.
     - A `.pdf` file of your presentation.

## üìä Part 2: Data Visualization with Tableau

### Introduction

In the second part of the capstone project, you will showcase your data visualization skills using Tableau. Choose a dataset with a minimum of 10 columns, featuring a mix of categorical and numerical variables.

### Deliverables

Your deliverables for this phase include:

1. **Presentation:**
   - Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation with a slide deck, transitioning to showcase your Tableau dashboard and the insights derived from it.

2. **Tableau Dashboard:**
   - Upload your Tableau dashboard to Tableau Public and provide the link.

### Important Note

Remember that data cleaning may be necessary before loading your dataset into Tableau. Ensure your dashboard is visually appealing and effectively communicates the story within your data.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance. Good luck everyone!!
